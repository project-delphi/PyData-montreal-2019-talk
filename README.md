# PyData Montreal 2019

![](./presentation/images/pyData-Montreal.png)

Here are my slides at PyData Montreal.

An imporant topic in our community is how to turn jupyter notebooks into production ready code. I can't say that I have all the solutions, but I share some of my pains and reflections.

Unfortunately I had a rendering accident with `reveal.js` not liking my HTML styling markup - this should be documented. (I wrote a whole blogpost about the ordeal - [here](https://project-delphi.github.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-vs-html/).)
